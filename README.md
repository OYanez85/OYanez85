# Hi there ğŸ‘‹
My name is Oscar, and I'm a MSc Data Science student interested in all things Python & Data Science!

ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on builduing up the basics of Python and its libraries: mainly Pandas & Numpy.

ğŸŒ± I recently built a code to automatically assess & analyze Past Medical Histories, check out all my codes here

ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Data Science projects!
